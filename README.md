# VCS-Redone
A couple of mods I bundled together for GTA VCS. The list of mods used is given below:-
1. Improved Vehicle Lights, Project2DFX, and Widescreen Fix by Thirteenag
2. HD HUD by Tervel1337
3. Upscaled textures by Bl4ckH4nd(https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo)
And I think that's all, if you think I used a mod of yours, reach out to me at @danrekt on discord, and if any of the authors have a problem with me using their mods, kindly reach out to me and I will take this down.
Works with the SLUS-21590 version of the game.
