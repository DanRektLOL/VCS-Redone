# VCS-Redone
A couple of mods I bundled together for GTA VCS. The list of mods used is given below:-
1. Improved Vehicle Lights, Project2DFX, and Widescreen Fix by Thirteenag
2. HD HUD by Tervel1337
3. Upscaled textures by [Bl4ckH4nd](https://gbatemp.net/members/bl4ckh4nd.609354)
And I think that's all, if you think I used a mod of yours, reach out to me at @danrekt on discord, and if any of the authors have a problem with me using their mods, reach out to me and I will take this down.
Works with the SLUS-21590 version of the game.
For certain missions, you will have to go to PLUGINS\GTAVCS.PCSX2F.WidescreenFix.ini and change the 60 FPS to 30. Keyboard is not fully supported so dont open an issue related to keyboard support in GTAVCS.PCSX2F.WidescreenFix.ini. I will zip and post this later as right now, I dont have the time.
